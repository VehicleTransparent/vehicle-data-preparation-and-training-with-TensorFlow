# Training a Custom model for Vehicle Detection with TensorFlow 2 Detection Model Zoo with bdd100k dataset.
### Introduction about this repository: 
* Read the descriptions and comments in Jupyter files.
* This repository is for Custom Vehicle Detection 'car, bus, truck' with bdd100k dataset
* The data preparation file depends on our use case, update the file to be compatible with your use case.
* We chose 'ssd_mobilenet_v2_fpnlite_320x320' for our case with trade-off its acceptable mean absolute precision 'mAP', and Speed in (ms) 'Problem dependant'.
* If you want to use another model, replace its name with our used model name, link, and model file name.
